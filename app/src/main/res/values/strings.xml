    <string name="about_app_text">
        This app is built to help you keep track of your finances.
        There are 3 categories of data you save, transactions, expenses and your income.
        Your total income is calculated after deducting all your expenses and transactions.
        The difference between a transaction and an expense is that a transaction is something
        random you purchase on a daily basis while an expense is a bill you incur at the end of a
        billing cycle such as an internet subscription, or your rent etc.
